## 🔄 Data Preprocessing  

### Steps Taken:  
#### **Transaction Fact Table Preprocessing:**  
- **Promote Headers:** Ensure the first row is used as column headers.  
- **Change Data Types:** Convert Transaction_ID to Int64, and other relevant columns to text or date.  
- **Remove Errors:** Eliminate rows with errors in Transaction_ID.  
- **Drop Unnecessary Columns:** Remove unused columns.  
- **Replace Null Values:** Fill missing values in Agent_ID and Merchant_ID with "Not found".  
- **Sort Transactions:** Arrange by Transaction_Date in ascending order.  
- **Standardize Data Types:** Convert ID fields to text.  
- **Add Index Column:** Create an index starting from 489434.  
- **Join with Customer Table:** Merge to bring Location and Gender.  
- **Fill Missing Data:** Replace null values with default values.  

#### **Dim Date Table Preprocessing:**  
- Define Date Range from MinOrderDate to MaxOrderDate.  
- Generate a continuous date list.  
- Extract Date Components (Year, Month, Quarter, Start of Month).  
- Format Date Information (Short Month Names, Quarter Formatting).  
- Classify Days as Weekend or Weekday.  
- Sort by Date.

## 🧮 DAX Measures  
### General Measures  
```DAX
Transaction Volume by agents = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(Transaction_Fact, Transaction_Fact[Channel] = "Agent"),
    RELATED(Revenue_Table[Revenue_Amount])
)
```
```DAX
Total Transactions by Agents = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Transaction_Fact[Transaction_ID]),
    Transaction_Fact[Channel] = "Agent"
)
```
```DAX
Total transaction volume = SUMX('Transaction_fact', RELATED('Revenue_table'[Revenue_Amount]))
```
```DAX
Total Transaction = DISTINCTCOUNT(Transaction_fact[Transaction_ID])
```
```DAX
Success Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(
        FILTER(
            'Transaction_fact',
            'Transaction_fact'[Transaction_Status] = "Successful"
        )
    ),
    COUNTROWS('Transaction_fact'),
    0
) 
```
