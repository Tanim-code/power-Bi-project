Customer Information = {
    ("Expenditure Analysis", NAMEOF('Measures Table'[Sales Per Customer]), 0),
    ("Demographic Analysis", NAMEOF('Measures Table'[Active Customers]), 1)
  }
```

**Customer/Sales Table:**

```DAX
    Customer/sales = {

```DAX
    Product Split = CROSSJOIN(
    {"A+", "Others"},
    SELECTCOLUMNS('Product Lookup', "Product Name", 'Product Lookup'[Product Name]))
```

**RFM value:**
```DAX
  RFM Table =
  SUMMARIZE( 'Customer Lookup' , 'Customer Lookup'[CustomerKey], "R Value" , [R Value],"F Value" , [Frequency] , "M Value" , [Monetary])
  ```

## 🧮 DAX Measures  
### General Measures  
```DAX

```DAX
